# RFID-and-IoT-based-Inventory-management-system
An inventory management system using ESP32 and RFID is a project that aims to track and manage the items in a warehouse or store using wireless tags and readers. The project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to communicate with an RFID module and read the data from the RFID tags attached to the items. The data is then sent to a cloud platform or a local server where it can be stored and analyzed. The project can help improve the efficiency and accuracy of inventory management and reduce human errors and costs.
